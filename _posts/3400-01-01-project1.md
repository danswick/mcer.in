Schools are sited near the children they serve and are safe for children to walk and bicycle. Parents, school districts, local governments, police and community partners work together to ensure the safety of children on the trip to and from school. Children of all abilities, income levels and cultures have traffic safety skills and regularly choose to walk and bicycle. These shifts result in communities with less traffic congestion and air pollution as well as more physically active children and families.
