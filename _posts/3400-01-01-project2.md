It's no wonder Haas Park was so busy: Logan Square has some of the least green space of any area of the city.  "You have Holstein Park, which is over a mile away, and of course there is Humboldt Park, but that's about four miles south," explained Porfirio.  "Haas Park is basically the green space for our community."

About a decade ago, the Haas Park Advisory Council, a small but dedicated group of community leaders, met to develop a vision fo rthe park's expansion.  They knew what they wanted - more room so the many activities organized by the park district and community members could flourish.  They just weren't sure how they would get it.
