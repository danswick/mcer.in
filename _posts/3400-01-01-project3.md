Chicago Public Schools is adding new safety routes this school year, which begins Sept. 8, officials said.

The seven new Safe Passage routes, as theyâ€™re called, affect about 2,500 students. CPS now has safety routes for some 75,000 schoolchildren.


Many of the new routes are near Altgeld Gardens on the far South Side.
